# Shaman Warrior Bitch (SWB)

**Shaman Warrior Bitch (SWB)** is a World of Warcraft addon designed for Turtle WoW (1.12.1) that helps shamans track the Windfury Totem aura on themselves and their group members. The addon provides a dynamic graphical user interface (GUI) that displays icons for each group member, showing whether they have the Windfury aura active. It also includes a timer to monitor the totemâ€™s remaining duration, along with options to customize the layout and size of the GUI.
